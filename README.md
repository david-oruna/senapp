### Overview

Signapp is an end to end deep learning project for recognizing sign language. It was trained using keypoints from MediaPipe [HandLandmarke](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker) with a LSTM. Then the model was compiled to TFLite and implemented in the Android application.
